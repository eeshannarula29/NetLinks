# Welcome to NetLinks

Easily Access and visualize different Data structures including Linked lists, Doubly Linked lists, Trees, Binary trees, Graphs, Stacks, and Queues.

I should also mention that much of the Basic data class structure is take from the
University of Toronto's CSC111 course. I and other collaborators are students at
University of Toronto, and currently taking CSC111.
